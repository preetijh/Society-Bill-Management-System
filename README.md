Implementation

The Society Bill Management System is built using Angular for the frontend. 
Components used in this Project :
•	Society Component
This is the main component of the application which is responsible for rendering the header and the other components of the application. It also defines the router-outlet which renders different components based on the current route.

•	Bill-Form Component
This component is responsible for rendering the form to create or update a bill. It takes input from the user and uses it to create or update a bill.

•	Bill-table Component
This component is responsible for rendering the table of bills. It retrieves the list of bills from the Society Service and displays it in a table format.



•	App Component
This is the root component of the application which serves as a container for other components.

•	Bill.model.ts file
This file contains the definition of the Bill model which is used to represent a bill in the application. It includes properties like id, name, amount, and date. This file is imported in other components and services to make use of the Bill model.

Future Improvements

The Society Bill Management System has room for improvement in the following areas:
More advanced reporting: The current reporting features are basic and could be improved with more advanced charting and visualization.
Mobile optimization: The system is currently optimized for desktop use and could be improved for mobile users.
Automated bill entry: The system currently requires users to manually enter their bills, but could be improved with automated entry from bank statements or other sources.

Conclusion

The Society Bill Management System is a useful tool for residents of a society or residential complex to manage their bills and expenses. With its user-friendly interface and powerful reporting features, the system helps users stay organized and keep track of their spending. As with any software, there is always room for improvement, but overall the Society Bill Management System is a solid solution for managing society bills.
